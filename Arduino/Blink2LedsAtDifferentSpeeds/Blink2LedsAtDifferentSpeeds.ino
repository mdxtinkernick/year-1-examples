/* Blink 2 LEDs at different speeds
 
 Turns on and off 2 light emitting diodes(LED) connected to digital  
 pins, without using the delay() function.  This means that we can flash the LEDs at totally different speeds.
 Based on the Arduino example BlinkWithoutDelay
 
 The circuit:
 * LED with resistor attached from pin 12 to ground.
 * LED with resistor attached from pin 11 to ground.
 
 This example code is in the public domain.
